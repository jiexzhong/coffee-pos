# BrewPoint
### Acknowledgements

This project, **BrewPoint**, was inspired and guided by the [react-pos tutorial](https://github.com/phithounsavanh/react-pos) created by Devtamin. This beginner-level tutorial helped enhance my understanding of React JS and Node.js, particularly in the development of a POS system.

Working through Devtamin's tutorial offered a clear and comprehensive overview of web application development. It served as a valuable resource for grasping the practical applications of these technologies in a business context.

**Note:** As of now, my primary adaptation to the project has been to alter the item list to suit a café theme, replacing the original grocery-focused items. This modification is a first step in customizing the application to fit a specific business niche.

Looking ahead, I plan to further tailor the application and introduce additional features that align with the unique needs and functionalities of a café setting. These future enhancements will be focused on expanding the project's capabilities and exploring new possibilities in web application development.

# BrewPoint POS WebApp: Project Overview

Welcome to the README for **BrewPoint**, a Point of Sale (POS) web application designed to simulate the experience of ordering from a café. This project showcases a practical application of a web-based POS system, utilizing mock data that represents a typical café menu with popular drink options.

### Project Description
**BrewPoint** is built to mimic the real-world functionality of a café's sales system, offering an intuitive and user-friendly interface for processing orders. The application is structured to provide a seamless experience from menu selection to order completion, incorporating mock data to represent a range of common café beverages.

### Technical Stack and Frameworks

**Development Tools:**
- **Node.js**: Utilized as the runtime environment for developing the server-side of the application.
- **React JS**: Chosen for its efficiency and flexibility, React JS is used to build a dynamic and responsive user interface.

**Backend:**
- **JSON Server**: Employs a simple REST API, providing a full fake REST API to simulate backend services and data storage.

**Frontend:**
- **React Router DOM**: Enables efficient navigation and routing for the web application.
- **React-to-Print**: Integrated to facilitate easy printing of orders or receipts directly from the application.
- **React Toastify**: Implemented to provide user-friendly notifications and alerts within the app.
- **Axios**: Used for making HTTP requests to interact with the backend.
- **Bootstrap**: Ensures a clean and responsive layout, enhancing the overall look and usability of the application.

### Project Goals
"The main goal of ***BrewPoint*** is to merge my personal interest in coffee and POS systems with the practical application of web technologies. This project serves as a hands-on experience in learning the basics of React and JSON server, focusing on creating a user-friendly and efficient tool for café environments."
